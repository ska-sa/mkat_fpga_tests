 * Encapsulation of a SPEAD stream. Packets are fed in through @ref add_packet.

 *
 * A collection of partial heaps is kept. Heaps are removed from this collection
 * and passed to @ref heap_ready when
 * - They are known to be complete (a heap length header is present and all the
 *   corresponding payload has been received); or
 * - Too many heaps are live: the one with the lowest ID is aged out, even if
 *   incomplete
 * - The stream is stopped
 *
 * This class is @em not thread-safe. Almost all use cases (possibly excluding
 * testing) will derive from @ref stream.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * The live heaps are stored in a circular queue (this has fewer pointer
 * indirections than @c std::deque). The heap cnts stored in another circular
 * queue with the same indexing. The heap cnt queue is redundant, but having a
 * separate queue of heap cnts reduces the number of cache lines touched to
 * find the right heap.
 *
 * When a heap is removed from the circular queue, the queue is not shifted
 * up. Instead, a hole is left. The queue thus only needs a head and not a
 * tail. When adding a new heap, any heap stored in the head position is
 * evicted. This means that heaps may be evicted before it is strictly
 * necessary from the point of view of available storage, but this prevents
 * heaps with lost packets from hanging around forever.
