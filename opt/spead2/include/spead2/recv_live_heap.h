 * Any SPEAD-64-* flavour can be used, but all packets in the heap must use
 * the same flavour. It may be possible to relax this, but it hasn't been
 * examined, and may cause issues for decoding descriptors (whose format
 * depends on the flavour).
 *
 * A heap can be:
 * - complete: a heap length item was found in a packet, and we have received
 *   all the payload corresponding to it. No more packets are expected.
 * - contiguous: the payload we have received is a contiguous range from 0 up
 *   to some amount, and cover all items described in the item pointers.
 * - incomplete: not contiguous
 * A complete heap is also contiguous, but not necessarily the other way
 * around. Only contiguous heaps can be frozen to @ref heap, and only
 * incomplete heaps can be frozen to @ref incomplete_heap.
