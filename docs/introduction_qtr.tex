\chapter{Introduction and Scope}
\section{Identification}
This document describes the Qualification Test Report (QTR) for the Correlator-Beamformer Test Prodcedure for DSP Functional Releases as described in [2].\newline

All Critical CBF functionality, for the concerned release, is tested. Functionality made available for AR2/3 is detailed in M1200-0000-001 Correlator-Beamformer Development Plan [1]. This release is provided for deployment of a new Functional Release to site.\newline

\subsection{Hardware identification}
For each Functional Release, the Correlator-Beamformer is deployed using the SKARAB hardware platform. The exact hardware configuration - including SKARAB boards, network switches and servers - employed for testing is described in this Qualification Test Report.

\subsection{Software/firmware release information}
The list of software, firmware, and gateware items, and their respective versions, employed for the Correlator-Beamformer Functional Release Qualification is described this Qualification Test Report.

Following qualification, formal release notes and software data packs for the Correlator-Beamformer software, gateware and firmware shall be released.
\section{Context}
This document categorises all tests according to Verification Events. Each Verification Event employs a test that fulfills a Verification Requirement. Each Verification Requirement, in turn, verifies one or more requirements. A single Verification Event, or test, may thefore verify multiple requirements.

Each Verification Event section presents the results of the test run during the particular Verification Event for the CBF mode under test.
\section{Purpose}
This document forms part of a set of Qualification Test Reports (QTRs) for the
CBF. The complete set of CBF QTRs documents the results of the qualification
test procedures required to verify that the CBF meets specification. The QTRs
generated during qualification of DSP Functional Releases may form part of the
Qualification Baseline Document Pack of CBF.\newline

This Qualification Test Report (QTR), together with the QTRs from other CBF Qualification Events, may be reviewed at the Critical Design Review (CDR) of the CBF.
