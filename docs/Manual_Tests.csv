Verify by analysis that CBF configuration data is stored on appropriate storage devices capable of retaining configuration data when in the OFF state for a period of at least 2 years.,CBF States and Modes VE,CBF.V.3.3,"Configuration Retention

1. Analyse the CBF storage architecture to determine whether the employed scheme is capable of retaining configuration data for a period of at least 2 years while the CBF is in the OFF state.

Transition from OFF state to INITIALISATION state

2. Start with the CBF off. Turn the CBF on by turning on power to the PDU(s). Start a stopwatch.
3. Observe that each of the LRUs powers up, loads any boot firmware, software bootloaders and operating systems, and launches the operational state software applications. This must be done completely automatically, manual intervention is not permitted.
4. During this boot process, send a KATCP status request message every few seconds. It is permissible for the CBF to be unresponsive while initialising.

Transition from INITIALISATION state to OPERATIONAL state

5. Continue sending status requests every few seconds, until the CBF response. This is considered to be an indication that the CBF has entered operational state. Record the time from when power was applied to when the CBF first responders to a status request.
6. Confirm that each of the processing nodes has been allocated an IP address, by inspecting the leases in dnsmasq.
7. If not, continue checking until this is the case, and record the time that it occurred.

CBF Reset and Restart

8. Restart the CBF by issuing the appropriate command on the CAM interface.
9. Send a status request, and confirm that the CBF does not respond.
10. Send a status request message every few seconds. It is permissible for the CBF to be unresponsive while initialising.
11. Continue sending status requests every few seconds, until the CBF response.
12. Record the time taken from reboot command to CBF responding.

Transition from INITIALISATION state to FAULT state

13. Turn the CBF CMC on.
14. After five seconds, remove the CAM network cable from the CMC.
15. Verify that the CMC remains unresponsive, indicating a Fault state.
16. Reconnect the CAM network cable to the port on the CMC.
17. Repeatedly issue KATCP system-info request messages every few seconds.
18. Continue sending system-info requests every few seconds, until the CBF response. This is considered to be an indication that the CBF has entered operational state.
","Configuration Retention

The CBF configuration data is stored on commercial, enterprise-class, magnetic Harddisk drives in a redundant RAID-1 array. This storage configuration provides retention of the CBF configuration data.

Transitions

1. Started with CBF in the OFF state. Turned on power to CBF via PDUs.
2. CBF became OPERATIONAL after 4 minutes. This included all switches. All processing nodes received IP addresses.
3. CBF restart issued via CAM interface.
4. Confirmed that CBF does not respond to CAM requests.
5. ERROR: CBF did not return, manually restarted KATCP.
6. CBF returned to OPERATIONAL state.
7. Network cable removed from CMC, CMC not responding.
8. Network cable restored, CMC returned to operational state after 30 seconds.

Signed, 2's complement numbers are employed. They accumulate 9-bits values (8 bit multiplier output), where the arrival rate depends on the channeliser configuration.

Considering the 4096-channel configuration at L-band and 500ms accumulations, 1712e6/8192*0.5=104492 additions take place per accumulation. The bit growth would be log2(104492)=16.67 bits. Thus, even at full-scale DC input values, only 17 bits of growth takes place. 9+17 = 26 bits. It is thus impossible to overflow the 32-bit accumulators with 500ms accumulations on L-band.

Considering the 32768-channel configuration at L-band and 500ms accumulations, the bit growth would be log2(1712e6/65536*0.5)=13.67 bits. Thus, no overflows are possible here, either.
