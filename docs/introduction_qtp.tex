\chapter{Introduction and Scope}
\section{Identification}
This Qualification Test Procedure document describes the qualification tests to be executed on the {\bf M1200-0000} Correlator-Beamformer of the MeerKAT Radio Telescope for Functional Releases.

This QTP only covers tests that test and qualify critical aspects of the Correlator-Beamformer.

\section{Version Information}
\subsection{Hardware identification}
For each Functional Release, the Correlator-Beamformer is deployed using the SKARAB hardware platform. Hardware to be utilized during qualification shall be identified prior to testing. The exact hardware configuration - including SKARAB boards, network switches and servers - employed for each run of this qualification test procedure shall be available in the applicable Qualification Test Reports.
\subsection{Software/firmware release information}
Software, gateware and firmware versions to be utilized during qualification shall be identified prior to testing. The list of software, firmware, and gateware items, and their respective versions, employed for this Correlator-Beamformer Functional Release Qualification shall be made available in the Qualification Test Reports.

Following qualification, formal release notes and software data packs for the Correlator-Beamformer software, gateware and firmware shall be released.
\section{Context}
This document categorises all tests according to Verification Events. Each Verification Event employs a test that fulfills a Verification Requirement. Each Verification Requirement, in turn, verifies one or more requirements. A single Verification Event, or test, may thefore verify multiple requirements.

This document only captures CBF requirements that are deemed critical to the perfomance of the Functional Release under test. The Resulting Qualification Test Reports will indicate which requirements are not tested.
\section{Purpose}
This document forms part of a set of Qualification Test Procedures (QTPs) for the CBF. The complete set of CBF QTPs document the test procedures required to verify that the CBF meets specification.
The resultant Qualification Test Report (QTR), together with the QTRs from other CBF Qualification Events, may be reviewed at the Critical Design Review (CDR) of the CBF.
