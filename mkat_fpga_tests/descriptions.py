        7. Compute the maximum of that ratio.
        8. Repeat for each PDU in each worksheet. The load balance test passes if the maximum ratio is less than 1.33 in each worksheet.
            - In each worksheet, make a column which computes total instantaneous power by multiplying current drawn over the three phases, multiplied by 220 i.e. (I Ph1+I Ph2+I Ph3)*220.
